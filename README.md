# My Lightning Collection

### Live page: https://my-lightning-collection.netlify.app/

This is a simple React application built with Vite that takes data from array of object and renders it on a page. It's a fun little project I made to help me keep track of which collectable figures I own from Hasbro's Power Rangers Lightning Collection series.

This project helped me get more comfortable with:

- passing props to components
- creating reusable components
- array methods (Array.map(), etc.)

## Getting Started

To run the app locally on your machine:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tsv-stacks/react-lightning-collection
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd lightning-collection
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
